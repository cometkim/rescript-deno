# ReScript Deno

ReScript bindings to Deno APIs.

## FAQ

### Isn't Deno for TypeScript?

Deno can host plain JavaScript. That means any Alt-JS languages can be hosted either.

### But Why?

Deno is a good platform. Even better with the better language.

### How can I verify this works?

You can run [examples](./examples) with the `yarn example` script.

```bash
# Build once before running.
yarn install
yarn build

yarn example example/catj.bs.js package.json
```
